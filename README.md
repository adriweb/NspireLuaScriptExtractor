TI-Nspire Lua script extractor from .tns files, with the help of the computer software

## Usage 
* Open your .tns file TI-Nspire Computer Software
* Copy (put in clipboard) the tab where the lua script is
* Simply launch the .jar file (you'll need to have Java installed)
* The extracted Lua source code will be in the same folder as the .jar


Needless to say, don't be evil and use it for goof, legitimate purposes (i.e. if you lost the password of your script).
I will not be held responsible for whatever can happen with this tool :)
